      <p>
          Hello everyone.  I am James Montealegre.  I am a part-time teacher at KCM Academy.  I teach web development and computer systems servicing in Senior High School.  I also teach Grade 10 students on the fundamentals of using Excel 2016.

<h2 style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size: 50px;">🏫</span>  Why did you enroll as an ICT student? Why not other tracks or strands?</h2>
    
    
      <p>
          My wife's colleague informed me that KCM is looking for teachers that will handle their ICT specialized subjects.  At first, I was a bit hesitant to apply since I do not have any teaching experience.  Then it occurred to me that I have other skills that will help me in a teaching career.  Some of my skills are facilitation,  recruitment, social media marketing, and my other tech skills.

 <h2 style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:50px">👨🏼‍🎓</span>  To whom are you dedicating your success in finishing course? Yourself,  family, friends, someone special etc. Why?</h2>
       
      <p style="color: #fff;">
          I am dedicating my teaching career to my students.  I hope that I may be able to share my knowledge not only on the subject that I am teaching but also the experiences in my journey.  I hope that in this academic year, we can create new and creative learning experiences that will give us a solid understanding of building websites.
